# Repository instructions for coding agents

## Hard limits

- Tech stack: React + TypeScript with strict TypeScript settings.
- Keep files small and modular; target max **200 lines per file**.
- Use Bun for dependency and script execution.
- Keep the UI minimal, practical, and dark-theme-first.
- Prefer responsive layouts that work on phone screens.

## Validation requirement

Before finishing any change, run:

- `bun run check`

Only finish when the check command passes.
